Java: Registration Madness Assignment

Thread-based concurrency assignment

From assignment webpage (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit594-2013/Assignments/09-registration-madness.html)

Registration for courses at Wossamatta U. is done electronically. Because there is contention for the most desirable courses, the instant that registration opens, all the students try to register for courses. The lucky ones get all their courses; the very unlucky ones may not get any courses they want. However, there is enough room for all students to get the required three courses.

The assignment is to write a complete simulation of 500 190 students trying to register for 24 offered courses. When the simulation is complete, print out some statistics about the result--how many students got their desired courses, etc. Also print out the total time that your program takes (should only be several seconds.)
